# Task 6 - Create a Strong Password & Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
To understand how to create secure passwords and evaluate them using online password strength tools.

---

## Passwords Tested

| Password | Strength |
|---------|----------|
| avadhoot123 | Weak |
| Avadhoot@2024 | Medium |
| Ava@2024!SecurePass | Strong |
| T!g3r$RunF@st2025 | Very Strong |

---

## Tools Used
- Password checker: passwordmeter.com

---

## Results Summary
- Weak passwords lack special characters & randomness.
- Medium passwords still contain predictable patterns.
- Strong passwords are long and contain all character types.
- Very strong passwords have high entropy and are hard to guess.

---

## Best Practices Learned
- Use 14+ character passwords
- Add upper/lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Avoid personal info (name, birthdate)
- Use passphrases
- Enable 2FA/MFA
- Store passwords in a password manager

---

## Final Output
The strongest password created:
**T!g3r$RunF@st2025** (Score: 95%)

## Common Password Attacks (Research Summary)
1. Brute Force Attack

-Trying every possible combination until successful.

2. Dictionary Attack

-Uses common words and leaked passwords.

3. Phishing Attack

-Tricking users to reveal their passwords.

4. Credential Stuffing

-Using leaked passwords from other websites.

## Why Password Length Matters

-Longer passwords have exponentially more combinations

-Makes brute force attacks extremely slow

-Example:

i)8-char password: cracked in minutes

ii)16-char strong password: millions of years

## Final Conclusion

-A strong password must be:
✔ Long
✔ Complex
✔ Not predictable
✔ Stored securely
